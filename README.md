# 🫁 Pneumonia Detection using CNN

This project applies **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify **chest X-ray images** into **Normal** or **Pneumonia**.  
The goal is to demonstrate how deep learning can assist in medical image analysis, providing a foundation for AI-assisted healthcare applications.
